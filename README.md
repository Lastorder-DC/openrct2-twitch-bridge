Send OpenRCT2 server chat to twitch, and vice versa.

## üöÄ Installation
1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Lastorder-DC/openrct2-twitch-bridge/releases).

2. To install it, extract downloaded zip file, and put `lib/twitch-bridge.js` file into your `/OpenRCT2/plugin` folder.

    * Easiest way to find the OpenRCT2-folder is by launching the OpenRCT2 game, click and hold on the red toolbox in the main menu, and select "Open custom content folder".
    * Otherwise this folder is commonly found in `C:\Users\<YOUR NAME>\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin` on Windows.
    * If you already had this plugin installed before, you can safely overwrite the old file.

3. Once the file is there, it should connect to chat bridge server when OpenRCT2 Multiplayer server is opened.
